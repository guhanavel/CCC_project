# CCC_project
This project is a full-stack application developed to monitor the status of the discharge counters at a vaccination center. It was my first full-stack project that I worked on while employed part-time at the vaccination center. The aim of this project is to enhance the discharge speed by providing real-time information about the current status of the stations.

## Features
Real-time monitoring of discharge counters
Status updates for each counter (Reay, Busy, Issue, Call Again)
Dashboard displaying the current status of all counters on the frontend
